# UI or component?

Would you consider a Table component more suitable for UI Component or a Business COmponent, I think the first

Let me think about this architecturally. A Table component is typically more suited as a UI Component rather than a Business Component, for several key reasons:

    A Table is fundamentally about presentation and layout - it's a way to display data in rows and columns, which is a pure UI concern. The actual business logic and data transformation should happen separately.
    Tables are highly reusable across different business contexts - the same table structure can display employees, products, transactions, etc. This reusability is a key characteristic of UI components.
    The core functionality of a table (sorting, pagination, column resizing, etc.) is UI-specific and independent of any business rules or domain logic.
    Business components should encapsulate domain-specific logic and workflows, while delegating their presentation to UI components like tables.

A good pattern would be:

    UI Layer: Table component (handles display, sorting, pagination)
    Business Layer: Components like EmployeeList, ProductCatalog that use the Table component but contain the business logic

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or show an example of how this separation might look in practice?
