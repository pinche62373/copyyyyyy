# Understanding the "Run Directly" Pattern in TypeScript Scripts

The "run directly" checks that appear at the end of our TypeScript scripts serve several important purposes. These checks appear in multiple files:

- configure-git.ts
- protect-upstream.ts
- sync-from-upstream.ts
- sync-to-origin.ts
- init-upstream.ts

## Purpose

### 1. Dual Usage Mode

These files are designed to work both as modules (when imported) and as standalone scripts (when run directly). This is an intentional pattern because:

- When imported as modules, they export their classes/functions for programmatic use
- When run directly (e.g., `npx tsx sync-from-upstream.ts`), they execute their main functionality

Example of exports:

```typescript
export { UpstreamPuller, type PullOptions };
```

### 2. CLI Integration

Looking at configure-git.ts, these scripts are meant to be run as Git aliases:

```typescript
// Configure the sync-from-upstream alias
const upstreamScript = "!npx tsx ./.sync/sync-from-upstream.ts";
this.git.execCommand(`git config alias.sync-from-upstream "${upstreamScript}"`);
```

### 3. Error Handling

The direct execution blocks include proper error handling and process exit codes, which are crucial for CLI usage but not needed when used as modules:

```typescript
if (isRunDirectly) {
  try {
    configurator.configure();
  } catch (error) {
    log.error("Configuration failed:", error);
    process.exit(1);  // CLI-specific error handling
  }
}
```

## Benefits

This pattern wasn't forgotten or accidentally copied - it's an intentional design choice that enables:

- Running scripts directly via Git aliases (`git sync-from-upstream`)
- Importing and using classes programmatically in other parts of the codebase
- Proper error handling and exit codes for CLI usage
- Clean separation between module exports and CLI behavior

While it might look like code duplication at first glance, it's actually a well-thought-out pattern for dual-mode operation of these scripts.
