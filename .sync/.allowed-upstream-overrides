# Allowed Upstream Overrides
#
# Lists files and directories from the upstream repository that can be modified locally.
# All other files from upstream will be protected from local modifications to prevent
# accidental changes.
#
# Use cases:
# - Local customizations that shouldn't be pushed upstream
# - Project-specific overrides of upstream defaults
# - Development environment configurations
#
# Format: 
# - One pattern per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Supports glob patterns (like .gitignore):
#   - * matches any number of characters except /
#   - ** matches any number of characters including /
#   - ? matches a single character
#   - directory/ matches directory and contents
#   - !pattern negates a previous pattern (exceptions)
#
# Glob override pattern:
# - First include directories/files you want to allow modifications for
# - Then exclude specific paths within those directories that should remain protected
#
# Examples:
# config/*.json            # Allow all JSON files in config directory
# !config/upstream.json    # But protect the upstream configuration
# assets/**/*.css         # Allow all CSS files in assets and subdirectories
# !assets/core/*.css      # But protect core CSS files
