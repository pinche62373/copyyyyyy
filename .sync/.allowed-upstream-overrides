# vim: syntax=gitignore

# Allowed Upstream Overrides
#
# Lists files and directories from the upstream repository that can be modified locally.
# All other files from upstream will be protected from local modifications to prevent
# accidental changes.
#
# Use cases:
# - Local customizations that shouldn't be pushed upstream
# - Project-specific overrides of upstream defaults
# - Development environment configurations
#
# Format: 
# - One pattern per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Supports glob patterns (like .gitignore):
#   - * matches any number of characters except /
#   - ** matches any number of characters including /
#   - ? matches a single character
#   - directory/ matches directory and contents
#   - !pattern negates a previous pattern (exceptions)
#
# Examples:
# config/*.json        # All JSON files in config directory
# assets/**/*.css      # All CSS files in assets and subdirectories
# local.settings.js    # Specific file
# dev/                 # Entire directory and contents

# Glob override pattern:
# - First exclude upstream directory and all its contents
# - Then allow other component directories
